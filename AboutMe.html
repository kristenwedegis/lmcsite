                    <p style="font-size: 20px"> My name is Kristen Wedegis. I am a student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, a candidate for a Bachelors of Science in Computational Media, a Chinese-American, a dancer, and a loved Child of God.<br>
                        <br>My mother was born and raised in Hong Kong, and I consider that to be my second home. Being Chinese-American is a large part of my identity, and I value both of my heritages greatly. I absolutely adore being able to celebrate both my cultures and interlace them in my daily life.<br>
                        <br>Though I am only nineteen years old, I have been able to explore many diverse areas of the world and hope to continue this as I get older!<br>

  <h2 class="yellowglow" style="text-align: left">My Beliefs</h2>
  <p>The most important aspect of who I am as a person is grounded in my faith. I was raised Christian and hold these teachings and beliefs firm in my heart today. All I do is for the glory of God, and I owe all my successes to Him. My faith has formed the cornerstone for the other facets of my personality and influences my life daily.</p>

<div id="MyAspirations" class="tabcontent" style="display:none">
  <h2 class="yellowglow" style="text-align: left">My Aspirations</h2>
  <p>As a Christian, I aspire to fulfill the role the Lord has created for me and spread His light and love while doing so. Due to my passion for design and interest in technology, the Lord has brought me to pursue a degree in Computational Media at Georgia Tech. This is my most prominent aspiration for this current season of my life.</p>
  <h4 style="color: #9C9346; margin-bottom: 6px;">Long term aspirations for future seasons of my life include:</h4>

                <p>Dancing is one of my favorite and greatest interests. To me, dance is an incredible type of performance media that allows individuals to portray concepts and emotions through stylized movement. Regarding my personal dance experiences, I have: </p>

            <h3 class="orangeglow">FOOD</h3>
                <p>A major interest of mine is food (specifically <b>good</b> food). I love cooking, searching for spots to eat, trying new types of cuisine - basically any and all things related to food preparation and consumption. <br><br>As a Chinese-American, my favorite type of food is authentic Chinese cuisine. From preparation to consumption,  I am in awe of every step of the process. Some of my favorite dishes are har gow (shrimp dumplings), lap mei fan (claypot rice), and what has become a global phenomena lately: bubble waffles.<br><br>Visit the <a href="PhotoGallery.html#food" title="photo gallery"><b>PHOTO GALLERY</b></a> to see more images of my favorite dishes!</p>

            <h3 class="purpleglow">TRAVEL</h3>
                <p>I love to travel for three primary reasons:</p>
            <ol  style="text-align: left;">
                <li>Travelling expands one's knowledge and view of the world through direct experience with those unlike oneself</li>
                <li>Through travel, people are able to have authentic interactions with God's magnificent and diverse creations, fostering crosscultural connections</li>
                <li>As a traveller, one is able to cultivate an open mind and attitude of acceptance through exposure to things, people, places, and concepts foreign to them</li>
            </ol>
